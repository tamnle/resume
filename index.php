      <h3><strong>WHY I AM INTERESTED IN BIG DATA?</strong></h3>

      <p>
        Within the rise of technology, Big Data is becoming one of the biggest concern for most businesses around the world.
        According to this, businesses will need data experts to manage their data system.
        However, most of business experts do not have a strong computing background, while computer
        scientists are mostly not familiar with business field. Therefore, the gap is created.
        And, my goal is fulfilling this gap.
        <br/><br/>
        To accomplish this goal, I'm going to study both B.S. in Computer Science and B.S.B.A. in Accounting.
        I believe that even this preparation step may take a lot of time, but it will be trustworthy.
        <br/><br/>
